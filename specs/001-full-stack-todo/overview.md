# Overview Specification: Full-Stack Todo Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-full-stack-todo`
**Created**: 2026-01-04
**Status**: Draft

## Purpose

This document provides an overview of the Full-Stack Todo Web Application for Phase II of Hackathon II. The objective is to transform the Phase I in-memory console todo application into a secure, multi-user, persistent web application using Spec-Driven Development with SpecifyPlus Kit.

## High-Level Description

The Full-Stack Todo Web Application will provide users with the ability to manage their personal tasks through a web interface. The application will feature user authentication, secure task management, and data persistence using modern web technologies.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user registration and login using JWT-based authentication
2. **Task Management**: Create, read, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete/incomplete
3. **User Isolation**: Each user can only access their own tasks
4. **Persistent Storage**: All tasks stored in Neon PostgreSQL database
5. **Responsive Web Interface**: Next.js-based frontend for optimal user experience

## Scope

This project includes:
- Next.js frontend application with user authentication
- Python FastAPI backend with JWT validation
- Neon PostgreSQL database with SQLModel ORM
- Better Auth integration for user management
- Complete API for task management operations

## Constraints

- No manual code editing allowed - all code must be generated by Qwen CLI
- Must follow the project constitution strictly
- Must remain compatible with Phase III (AI Chatbot)
- All API endpoints must follow the specified REST patterns
- User isolation must be enforced at all levels

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:
- All users can register and authenticate securely
- Users can manage their tasks independently
- Proper user isolation is enforced
- Application is deployed and functional
- Ready for Phase III integration
